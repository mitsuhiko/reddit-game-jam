How to get this running.

THe following libraries have to be downloaded and unzipped into
the libs folder:

  - sdl-1.3             http://www.libsdl.org/

Additionally these have to be built.  Unfortunately SDL does not work
without installation so make sure to set the prefix to just ``local``
because this is where the CMakeLists.txt file looks for it.  Do not
attempt other versions of the libraries as these are hardcoded in the
CMakeLists.txt file for the time being.
